# Make the most of your data

Let's be realistic: getting the most out of your data can be difficult. These days, even many small companies are dealing with volumes that would have been considered 'big data' just a few years ago. And it's not just the volume of data which is proliferating, but the number of sources as well. You might have data for your application, HR, finance, customers, sales, project management, and more. The average small company (fewer than 500 employees) has 172 applications in their tech stack, spends $7.9m/year on tech, and adds 4.4 new applications per month. And if you're a tech company, the data picture is even more complicated, because you're probably using even more tools. Every time you add an application, the picture gets more complex because each one of those apps might require interfacing or integration with several others, so complexity grows non-linearly with the number of applications in your stack.

But for every one of these companies that have found a formula for transforming their business...

I'm continually astonished at the number of companies that conduct their analytics as if they were still operating in 2010 or 2000 (I'm not joking), blissfully (or more like agonizingly) unaware of those better tools which could dramatically improve ther analytics operations. There are more companies who are aware that they need better tools, but struggle with the decision of which tools, in which combination, will work best for them. Even when they have identified their ideal stack, yet more comanies . The most important solutions are not always technical, or at least not primarily so. Sometimes those solutions are cultural and organizational. You can have the best team members, but if that team isn't organized properly,
