One of the most common data projects involves migrating data from one source to another. Maybe you are replacing an old application with something better, but need to make sure the existing data is seamlessly available to the new application. Perhaps you are building a new data warehouse, lakehouse, or delta lake, and need to make sure the data is available in the new architecture. Migrations can be time-consuming, frustrating, and involve numerous sub-problems that you didn't anticipate up front. If you need help with a migration project, [get in touch](/contact/), and I can help you make sure that all your important data ends up in the right place.
