One of the great things about [GitHub](https://github.com/) is its many built-in features for working with code, among them displaying code blocks, language-aware syntax highlighting, and the like.

If you haven't noticed, this site is built consciously to look like GitHub, in part because of the choice of theme - [LoveIt](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/loveit/), by Dillon (great work, Dillon!). Particularly with the dark version of the LoveIt theme (click at the top right of any page to switch between light and dark modes), the site resembles GitHub with its grey-on-grey theme (which I'm obviously a big fan of). Part of the reason for that appearance choice, which hopefully makes people think of GitHub, is that this site is text- and code-focused, rather than being heavily graphical. I'm a data developer working almost exclusively on the backend, and graphical and front-end web design are not among my skills. So I wanted a choice of theme that would look good with large amounts of text and minimal graphics (which, for better or worse, is the world I work in, and I want the site to convey that).
