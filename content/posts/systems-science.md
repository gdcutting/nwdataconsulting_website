My master's degree is in Systems Science, an important but little understood interdisciplinary field... While much of the specific content of the field is beyond the scope of my data consulting work, I'd like to take a bit of time to explain how that choice of field has positively affected my professional development. If you're reading this then you're probably considering hiring a consultant (which is a [significant investment](/services)), and it's worth me taking a few moments of your time for some informative self-marketing to help you understand why paying for my time and advice would be a good investment.

Systems Science has dual origins - first from cybernetics (which heavily involves control theory and was the forerunner of modern AI) and decision science (particuarly for large organizations) (GE story)
