This post is hopefully the first in a series on the topic of prompt engineering, which has become of topic of heavy discussion with the explosion of [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), [Bard](https://bard.google.com), and other (generally GPT-based) chat bots onto the AI scene. 

I'd like to take a moment to discuss [Google Bard](https://bard.google.com), which has not received nearly the kind of press attention that ChatGPT has, but which should certainly be considered a worthy competitor... Personally my loyalty has always laid with Google over Microsoft. I've always thought Windows was a disaster, and for a long time (from my youth until a few years ago), I eschewed Microsoft products altogether, refusing to use Windows unless absolutely necessary, and only using Word and Excel occasionally because they were, I grudgingly had to admit, better than any of the alternatives. Microsoft started to win me back bit by bit, starting with VSCode a few years back, and continuing with OneNote, which I found to be hands-down the best note-taking tool for a large writing project like [my novel](https://www.guycutting.com/fiction/excerpts-from-our-american-comrade).

One key difference, as of the writing of this article (July 25, 2023) is that ChatGPT has commercial availability (you can sign up for a paid version of the service with extra features, and ChatGPT is being integrated into commercial products like Bing search)...
