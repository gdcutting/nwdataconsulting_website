Now that I've been working a lot with Hugo and gotten my development setup dialed in, I wanted to take a moment to discuss that setup. For a lot of coders this is a favorite topic of discussion: workflow optimization. There are so many tools available that it's easy to get overwhelmed, and it's important to continually work on tuning your development workflow to stay efficient and get as much as possible done with the tools available...

VSCode has been a real joy to work with. I never thought I would say that about a Microsoft product, but having aggressively left the Microsoft fold in my younger days (twenty five years ago, when I first began to experiment with Linux in middle school), I was finally brought back into that fold by my positive experience with VSCode. Code has so many features that it's hard to know where to start: a lightweight (and fast) underlying editor that is mind-boggingly extensible, lots of keyboard shortcuts, code completion, interactive debugging, and a lot more.
