There's a lot to like about DataBricks, a platform that has taken the data world by storm in the last several years. One of the many things that I like about DataBricks is all the valuable product and training information they offer, information that often goes beyond the DataBricks products themselves and extends to Spark and the underlying technologies. DataBricks was founded by some of the creators of the Apache Spark project, which is one of the foundational tools in the data engineering / science / analytics space, so their training material focuses heavily on Spark since the two products are tied so closely together.

I discovered that DataBricks publishes a number of free short training ebooks that can be downloaded for free on their site. These are typically shortened versions of ebooks often featuring preview material of books that have not been published yet. So going through this material is a great way to boost a number of skills and get access to some leading-edge information that isn't otherwise easily available yet. 

I downloaded the handful of ebooks that I could find on the site and am re-posting them here with brief descriptions:

**[Data Engineer's Guide to Apache Spark and Delta Lake](/data-engineers-guide-apache-spark-delta-lake-v3.pdf)** - Contains a lot of great basic but essential information on setting up and using Spark, and finishes up with a chapter on using Spark with Delta Lake. From the [DataBricks Docs](https://docs.databricks.com), "Delta Lake is the optimized storage layer that provides the foundation for storing data and tables in the Databricks Lakehouse Platform. Delta Lake is open source software that extends Parquet data files with a file-based transaction log for ACID transactions and scalable metadata handling. Delta Lake is fully compatible with Apache Spark APIs, and was developed for tight integration with Structured Streaming, allowing you to easily use a single copy of data for both batch and streaming operations and providing incremental processing at scale."

**[Delta Lake: Up and Running: Modern Data Lakehouse Architectures with Delta Lake](/delta-lake-up-&-running_er2.pdf)** - Contains great information about data warehouse architectures in general, getting started with Delta Lake, and a lot of details about the file format and how to work with it. 

**[The Big Book of Data Engineering: A collection of technical blogs, including code samples and notebooks](/Big-Book-of-Data-Engineering-Final.pdf)** - Contains an introduction to Data Engineering on DataBricks, several interesting and diverse use cases for the DataBricks Lakehouse platform, and a section on customer stories.

**[Delta Lake, The Definitive Guide: Modern Data Lakehouse Architectures with Delta Lake](/definitive-guide-deltalake.pdf)** - Contains information on basic operations on Delta Lakes, 'Time Travel' with Delta Lake, and continuous / streaming operations with Delta Lake. 

**[The Data Lakehouse Platform For Dummies](/data_lakehouse_dummies.pdf)** - Covers limitations of current data warehouse architectures, introduces the lakehouse approach, describes the values and benefits of the newer approach, and discusses building a modern lakehouse architecture with DataBricks.

There's a few hundred pages of great information all together in these ebooks, from the conceptual (discussion of various warehouse architectures and all the lakehouse has to offer) to the technical and very hands-on. Here at Northwest Data Consulting we strive to always be as up to date as possible on the concepts and tools of the trade, and the lakehouse architecture (along with DataBrick's Delta Lake-based implementation of it) have been a force to be reckoned with in the cloud data space. [Gartner has named DataBricks a leader two years running](https://www.databricks.com/resources/analyst-paper/databricks-named-leader-by-gartner) in Cloud Database Management Systems, so they are definitely a company to watch, and they're making a lot of great information available for free to those of us who are trying to stay on top of the often-difficult task of getting the most out of our data.
