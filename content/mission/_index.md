My mission is to help you and your organization take the greatest possible advantage of your data. In today's business world, the most successful companies are the ones which not only understand the importance of their data as an asset and put the proper tools in place, but which create technical and organizational cultures that maximize the impact of their data operations.

<br>

Merely having a lot of data is not enough. Having a lot of data without the proper culture in place to manage and leverage it can easily [lead to overwhelm](/posts/overwhelm/). Being overwhelmed with data can result in significant costs if you're spending money on tools and employees that aren't working well together, and which aren't consistently providing the answers to the most important business questions you ask every day.

<br>

I've worked with organizations of all sizes, from single proprietors and small startups to large multinationals. And every one of those organizations faced ongoing challenges in managing their data. Some of the biggest organizations face the biggest challenges, because more data means more complex systems with more moving parts.

<br>

One of the biggest lessons I've learned is that while many of the challenges in leveraging your data are technical, creating a truly data-driven organization is not only a technical problem. Having the best and/or most expensive tools in place will only take you so far if you don't have the right organizational culture. If your data team is not well-ordered, and it does not interface well with the rest of the organization, this can create much bigger problems than an incorrect technical choice.

<br>

You can hire data analysts, data scientists, cloud architects and engineers, data engineers, and many other roles. But if these roles aren't clearly defined, and don't work together in the right ways, your company can still struggle to stay on top of your data operations. I can help you not only choose the right tools, but put the right team in place to make the best use of them. And I can provide advice and training to help your team function well together and be more than the sum of its parts.

<br>

There are a lot of consultants out there, but most of them specialize in one area - data science, data engineering, etc. I'm inspired to provide consulting services across a range of areas, because getting data right requires seeing the big picture. Taking a holistic view of a company's data is the best approach to solving their problems.

<br>

If you know you need consulting in one specific area (such as developing better reports), I'm happy to provide that. Sometimes you don't need to change your whole approach to data, but simply need improvements in a specific area. My experience has taught me, though, that what organizations think they need is often not the same as what they actually need. I believe that my greatest value is in putting all the pieces together and looking at the big puzzle picture. If you decide to work with me, we'll do a thorough assessment to figure out your true needs, and adjust our approach as required as the project progresses.
